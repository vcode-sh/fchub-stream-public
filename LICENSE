## Beta Testing Period (Current)

**FREE TO USE** during beta testing.

By using FCHub Stream during beta, you agree to:

1. **Test the plugin** - Find bugs. Report them. Help improve it.
2. **No commercial use** - Testing only. Not for production commercial sites yet.
3. **No warranty** - Beta software. Shit breaks. That's expected.
4. **Beta ends when announced** - You'll know when. Trust me.

## After Beta (Future)

**Commercial License** - Plugin becomes paid.

Pricing: TBA. When I figure it out, you'll know.

Current beta users will get early bird pricing. Because you helped.

## Restrictions
