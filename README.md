# FCHub Stream

Video streaming for FluentCommunity. Built because WordPress media library and video don't mix.

Direct uploads to Cloudflare Stream or Bunny.net. No media library gymnastics. No manual video conversion. Pick your provider. Upload videos. Done.

## What It Does

- **Direct Uploads** - Videos go straight to streaming provider. Zero WordPress media library involvement.
- **Two Providers** - Cloudflare Stream or Bunny.net. Pick one. Both work.
- **Drag & Drop** - Upload interface that doesn't make you cry.
- **Auto Cleanup** - Delete post? Video gets deleted too. Revolutionary? No. Functional? Yes.
